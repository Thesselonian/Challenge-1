### Refactor Effort ###

The website was refactored in order to:

2) Consolidate css code
3) Replace div's with semantic elements
4) Add alt attributes to image elements
5) Fix a broken navigation link 
6) Delete extraneous code
7) Change title of website to "Horiseon"

### Appearance of Webpage ###

The styling was left intact as compared against the original code that was provided.

### Future Work ###

In the future this site will be improved to include responsive media queries for mobile application accessibility.
